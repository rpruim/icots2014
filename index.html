<p>Welcome to the website for the iCOTS 2014 Workshop on Teaching Statistics with R and RStudio. 
We will use this website to provide information about the workshop and links to supporting
materials.

<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
This workshop will introduce participants to teaching applied statistics
courses using computing in an integrated way. The presenters have been using R to teach statistics to undergraduates at all levels for the last decade and will share their approach and some of their favorite examples.  Topics will include workflow in the RStudio environment, providing novices with a powerful but manageable set of tools, and data visualization. Much of this will be facilitated using the mosaic package. The workshop is designed to be accessible to those with little or no experience teaching with R, and will provide participants with skills, examples, and resources that they can use in their own teaching.

Bring your own laptop.
